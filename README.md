Tony Ayala's Project 1

I work for a real estate developer building an apartment building in Denver. I decided to build a website for marketing that building to potential residents. I thought this would be a good type of website to implement the different tools that we've learned, such as forms, a gallery of photos, and google maps. This is also the first project I have done as a real estate developer, so I am particularly attached to the building.
